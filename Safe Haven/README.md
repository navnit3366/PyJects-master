## Motivation

Invasion of privacy is a serious issue. The main reason I built this application was to help people hide their secret files and folders from prying eyes.
With this application, you can rest at peace knowing that your files are safely hidden away.

**Note** : Safe-Haven only hides your files. It does not secure them.

## Usage

Firstly, Create a folder with all the files you want to hide. Once done,

Run the `Safe-Haven.py` file present in the `src` folder.

Now, copy the address of the folder you created earlier and paste it in the application.

Next, the application asks where you want to create your secure folder. Give it the address of the folder you want to save it to. Eg: `C:\Users\Username\Desktop`.

Now, when it asks for a password, provide a password that is atleast 3 characters in length.<br>
**Note** : Password has to be an integer.

Now, A folder with the name Safe-Haven will be created at the location provided. To access your secret files that you hid. Open Safe-Haven and navigate folders from 1-10 based on the password entered.
Eg : If you password was 157, Open Safe-Haven folder and open folder 1 and then 5 and then 7. You can find your folder with all the files here.
