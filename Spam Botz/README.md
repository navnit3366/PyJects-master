There is no real motivation behind building a spam bot but to simply annoy people.<br>
Or at times even crash the application. 

This application allows you to spam in variations, like : 
- Spamming a fixed static message.
- Spamming random words from a dictionary.
- Sending sequences of numbers.
- Randomly spamming large numbers.
- Breaking a sentence into its component words and spam them as seperate messages.
- Good old Rage spam, but this time without breaking your keyboard.
